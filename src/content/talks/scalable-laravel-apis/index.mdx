Join me for an engaging session where we will dive into the world of APIs. These aren't your grandparents APIs either, they are modern and scalable APIs built with Laravel.
Whether you are a newbie when it comes to APIs, or an experienced API efficianado, this talk will help to equip you with the tools and techniques to build robust, scalable, high-performing APIs in a way that I have found works best. We are going to cover everything from best practices in design and architecture, to leveraging Laravel's powerful features for helping us scale, and packages that are a must have for any modern Laravel developer who cares about APIs.
Expect live demos, some real-world examples, and plenty of information for you to take to your next project. Don't miss out on this opportunity to take your API from REST to the best.
